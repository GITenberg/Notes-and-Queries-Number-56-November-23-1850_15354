<h2>NOTES.</h2>

<h3>THE OLDENBURG HORN.</h3>

  <p>The highly interesting collection of pictures at Combe Abbey, the seat
  of the Earl of Craven, in Warwickshire, was, for the most part,
  bequeathed by Elizabeth, Queen of Bohemia, the daughter of James I., to
  her faithful attendant, William, Earl of Craven. The collection has
  remained, entire and undisturbed, up to the present time. Near the upper
  end of the long gallery is a picture which doubtless formed a part of the
  bequest of the Queen of Bohemia, and of which the following is a
  description:&mdash;</p>

  <p>Three quarters length: a female figure, standing, with long curling
  light hair, and a wreath of flowers round the head. She wears a white
  satin gown, with a yellow edge; gold chain on the stomacher, and pearl
  buttons down the front. She has a pearl necklace and earrings, with a
  high plaited chemisette up to the necklace; and four rows of pearls, with
  a yellow bow, round the sleeve. She holds in her hands a large highly
  ornamented gold horn. The back-ground consists of mountains. Underneath
  the picture is this inscription:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Anno post natum Christum 939. Ottoni comiti Oldenburgico in venatione
  vehementer sitibundo virgo elegantissima ex monte Osen prodiens cornu
  argenteum deauratum plenum liquore ut biberet obtulit. Inspecto is
  liquore adhorruit, ac eundum bibere recusavit. Quo facto, subito Comes a
  virgine discedens liquorem retro super equum quem mox depilavit effudit,
  cornuque hic depictum secum Oldenburgum in perpetuam illius memoriam
  reportavit. Lucretio de Sainct Simon pinxit."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The painting is apparently of the first part of the seventeenth
  century. The ordinary books of reference do not contain the painter's
  name.</p>

  <p>The same legend as that contained in this inscription, though with
  fuller details, is given by the brothers Grimm, in their collection of
  <i>Deutsche Sagen</i>, No. 541. vol. ii. p. 317., from two Oldenburg
  chronicles. According to this version Otto was Count of Oldenburg in the
  year 990 or 967. [The chronicles appear to differ as to his date: the
  inscription of the Combe Abbey picture furnishes a third date.] Being a
  good hunter, and fond of hunting, he went, on the 20th of July, in this
  year, attended by his nobles and servants, to hunt in the forest of
  Bernefeuer. Here he found a deer, and chased it alone from this wood to
  Mount Osen: but in the pursuit he left his companions and even his dogs
  behind; and he stood alone, on his white horse, in the middle of the
  mountain. Being now exhausted by the great heat, he exclaimed: "Would to
  God that some one had a draught of cold water!" As soon as the count had
  uttered these words, the mountain opened, and from the <!-- Page 418
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page418" id="page418"></a>{418}</span>
  chasm there came a beautiful damsel, dressed in fine clothes, with her
  hair divided over her shoulders, and a wreath of flowers on her head. In
  her hand she held a precious silver-gilt hunting-horn, filled with some
  liquid; which she offered to the count, in order that he might drink. The
  count took the horn, and examined the liquid, but declined to drink it.
  Whereupon the damsel said: "My dear lord, drink it upon my assurance; for
  it will do you no harm, but will tend to your good." She added that, if
  he would drink, he and his family, and all his descendants, and the whole
  territory of Oldenburg, would prosper: but that, if he refused, there
  would be discord in the race of the Counts of Oldenburg. The count, as
  was natural, mistrusted her assurances, and feared to drink out of the
  horn: however, he retained it in his hand, and swung it behind his back.
  While it was in this position some of the liquid escaped; and where it
  fell on the back of the white horse, it took off the hair. When the
  damsel saw this, she asked him to restore the horn; but the count, with
  the horn in his hand, hastened away from the mountain, and, on looking
  back, observed that the damsel had returned into the earth. The count,
  terrified at the sight, spurred on his horse, and speedily rejoined his
  attendants: he then recounted to them his adventure, and showed them the
  silver-gilt horn, which he took with him to Oldenburg. And because this
  horn was obtained in so wonderful a manner, it was kept as a precious
  relic by him and all his successors in the reigning house of
  Oldenburg.</p>

  <p>The editors state that richly decorated drinking-horn was formerly
  preserved, with great care, in the family of Oldenburg; but that, at the
  present time [1818], it is at Copenhagen.</p>

  <p>The same story is related from Hamelmann's <i>Oldenburg Chronicle</i>,
  by Büsching, in his <i>Volksagen</i> (Leips. 1820), p. 380., who states
  that there is a representation of the horn in p. 20. of the
  <i>Chronicle</i>, as well as in the title-page of the first volume of the
  <i>Wunderhorn</i>.</p>

  <p>Those who are accustomed to the interpretation of mythological
  fictions will at once recognise in this story an explanatory legend,
  invented for the purpose of giving an interest to a valuable
  drinking-horn, of ancient work, which belonged to the Counts of
  Oldenburg. Had the story not started from a basis of real fact, but had
  been pure fiction, the mountain-spirit would probably have left, not
  <i>silver gilt</i>, but a <i>gold</i> horn, with the count. Moreover, the
  manner in which she suffers herself to be outwitted, and her acquiescence
  in the loss of her horn, without exacting some vengeance from the
  incredulous count, are not in the spirit of such fictions, nor do they
  suit the malignant character which the legend itself gives her. If the
  Oldenburg horn is still preserved at Copenhagen, its date might doubtless
  be determined by the style of the work.</p>

  <p>Mount Osen seems to have been a place which abounded in supernatural
  beings. Some elves who came from this mountain to take fresh-brewed beer,
  and left good, though unknown money, to pay for it, are mentioned in
  another story in the <i>Deutsche Sagen</i>, (No.43. vol. i. p. 55.)</p>

  <p class="author">L.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Having had an opportunity of inspecting a copy of Hamelmann's
  <i>Chronicle</i>, at present belonging to Mr. Quaritch, in which there is
  a very interesting engraving of the horn in question (which may possibly
  have been a Charter Horn), we are not disposed to pronounce it older than
  the latter end of the fifteenth century. If, however, it is still
  preserved at Copenhagen, some correspondent there will perhaps do us the
  favour to furnish us with a precise description of it, and with the
  various legends which are inscribed upon it.&mdash;ED.]</p>

<h3>GREEK PARTICLES ILLUSTRATED BY THE EASTERN LANGUAGES.</h3>

  <p>The affinity which exists between such of the vernacular languages of
  India as are offshoots of the Sanscrit, as the Hindostanee, Mahratta,
  Guzeratee, &amp;c., and the Greek, Latin, German, and English languages,
  is now well known to European scholars, more especially since the
  publication of the researches of Vans Kennedy, Professor Bopp of Berlin,
  &amp;c. Indeed, scarcely a day passes in which the European resident in
  India may not recognise, in his intercourse with the natives, many
  familiar words in all those languages, clothed in an oriental dress. I am
  inclined also to think that new light may be thrown upon some of the
  impracticable Greek particles by a reference to the languages of the
  East; and without wishing to be understood as laying down anything
  dogmatically in the present communication, I hope, through the medium of
  your valuable publication, to attract attention to this subject, and
  invite discussion on it. Taking, as an illustration, the 233d line of the
  first book of the <i>Iliad</i>, where the hero of the poem is violently
  abusing Agamemnon for depriving him of his prize, the fair maid Briseis,
  he says,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><span lang="el" title="'All' ek toi ereô, kai epi megan horkon homoumai.'" >"&#913;&#955;&#955;' &#949;&#954; &#964;&#959;&#953; &#949;&#961;&#949;&#969;, &#954;&#945;&#953; &#949;&#960;&#953; &#956;&#949;&#947;&#945;&#957; &#8219;&#959;&#961;&#954;&#959;&#957; &#8219;&#959;&#956;&#959;&#965;&#956;&#945;&#953;."</span></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>What is the meaning of <span lang="el" title="ek" >&#949;&#954;</span>
  in the above line? It is commonly construed with <span lang="el"
  title="ereô" >&#949;&#961;&#949;&#969;</span>, and translated, "I plainly
  tell thee&mdash;I declare to thee;" <span lang="el" title="exereô"
  >&#949;&#958;&#949;&#961;&#949;&#969;</span>, "I speak
  out&mdash;proclaim." But may it not be identical with the Sanscrit
  <i>ek</i>, "one," a word, as most of your readers are doubtless aware, in
  universal use throughout India, Persia, &amp;c; the rendering literally
  running thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"But <i>one</i> thing I tell thee," &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>That this is the original sense of the line appears probable by
  comparing it with line 297. of the <!-- Page 419 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page419" id="page419"></a>{419}</span> same
  book, where in the <i>second</i> speech of Achilles, that <i>impiger,
  iracundus, inexorabilis, acer</i>, chieftain <i>again</i> scolds "the
  king of men,"&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"<span lang="el" title="Allo de toi ereô, sy d' ene phresi balleo sêsi." >&#913;&#955;&#955;&#959; &#948;&#949; &#964;&#959;&#953; &#949;&#961;&#949;&#969;, &#963;&#965; &#948;' &#949;&#957;&#949; &#966;&#961;&#949;&#963;&#953; &#946;&#945;&#955;&#955;&#949;&#959; &#963;&#951;&#963;&#953;.</span>"</p>
      <p class="i4">"And <i>another</i> thing I tell thee."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>This rendering receives additional confirmation by a comparison with
  the following:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"<span lang="el" title="Touto de toi ereô." >&#932;&#959;&#965;&#964;&#959; &#948;&#949; &#964;&#959;&#953; &#949;&#961;&#949;&#969;.</span>"</p>
      <p class="i4"><i>Il.</i> iii. 177., and <i>Od.</i> vii. 243.</p>
      <p>"<span lang="el" title="Panta de toi ereô." >&#928;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#945; &#948;&#949; &#964;&#959;&#953; &#949;&#961;&#949;&#969;.</span>"</p>
      <p class="i4"><i>Od.</i> iv. 410., and x. 289.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In the last three lines <span lang="el" title="Allo"
  >&#913;&#955;&#955;&#959;</span>, <span lang="el" title="Touto"
  >&#932;&#959;&#965;&#964;&#959;</span>, and <span lang="el" title="Panta"
  >&#928;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#945;</span> stand precisely in the same
  relation to <span lang="el" title="ereô" >&#949;&#961;&#949;&#969;</span>
  that <span lang="el" title="ek" >&#949;&#954;</span> does in the first,
  <span lang="el" title="All'" >&#913;&#955;&#955;'</span> merely taking
  the place of <span lang="el" title="de" >&#948;&#949;</span>, for the
  sake of versification.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"But <i>one</i> thing I tell thee.</p>
      <p>And <i>another</i> thing I tell thee.</p>
      <p>But <i>this</i> thing I tell thee.</p>
      <p>And <i>all</i> things I tell thee."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>It is not impossible that <span lang="el" title="exereô"
  >&#949;&#958;&#949;&#961;&#949;&#969;</span> may be a compound of <span
  lang="el" title="ek" >&#949;&#954;</span>, "one," and <span lang="el"
  title="ereô" >&#949;&#961;&#949;&#969;</span>, "I speak." There is in the
  Hindostanee an analogous form of expression, <i>Ek bat bolo</i>, "one
  word speak." This is constantly used to denote, speaking plainly; to
  speak decidedly; one word only; no display of unnecessary verbiage to
  conceal thought; no humbug; I tell thee plainly; I speak
  solemnly&mdash;once for all; which is precisely the meaning of <span
  lang="el" title="exereô" >&#949;&#958;&#949;&#961;&#949;&#969;</span> in
  all the passages where it occurs in Homer: <i>e.g.</i> <i>Il.</i> i. 212.
  (where it is employed by Minerva in her solemn address to Achilles);

<h3>SAMUEL ROWLANDS, AND HIS CLAIM TO THE
AUTHORSHIP OF "THE CHOISE OF CHANGE."</h3>

  <p>Mr. T. Jones in "NOTES AND QUERIES" (Vol. i., p. 39.), describing a
  copy of <i>The Choise of Change</i> in the Chetham Library,
  unhesitatingly ascribes its authorship to the well-known satirist, Samuel
  Rowlands, whom he says, "appears to have been a Welshman from his love of
  Triads." Mr. JONES'S dictum, that the letters "S.R.," on the title-page
  "are the well-known initials of Samuel Rowlands," may well, I think, be
  questioned. Great caution should be used in these matters. Bibliographers
  and catalogue-makers are constantly making confusion by assigning works,
  which bear the initials only, to wrong authors.</p>

  <p><i>The Choise of Change</i> may with much more probability be given to
  a very different author. I have a copy of the edition of 1598 now before
  me, in which the name is filled up, in a cotemporary hand, S[imon],
  R[obson]. And I find in Lowndes' <i>Bibliographer's Manual</i>, that the
  work in question is entered under the latter name. The compiler
  adds,&mdash;"This piece is by some attributed to Dr. Simon Robson, Dean
  of Bristol in 1598; by others, most probably erroneously, to Samuel
  Rowland." An examination of the biography of Dr. Robson, who died in
  1617, might tend to elucidate some particulars concerning his claim to
  the authorship of this and several other works of similar character.</p>

  <p>Samuel Rowland's earliest publication is supposed to have been <i>The
  Betraying of Christ</i>, &amp;c., printed in 1598. If it can be proved
  that he has any claim to <i>The Choise of Change</i> (first printed in
  1585), we make him an author <i>thirteen</i> years earlier. In the
  title-page of the latter, the writer, whoever he was, is styled "Gent and
  Student in the Universitie of Cambridge." This is a fact of some
  importance towards the elucidation of authorship and has, I believe,
  escaped the notice of those writers who have touched upon Samuel
  Rowland's scanty biography. But I can hardly conceive that either of the
  publications above alluded to came from the same pen as <i>Humours
  Ordinarie</i>, <i>Martin Mark-all</i>, <i>The Four Knaves</i>, and many
  others of the same class, which are known to have been the productions of
  Samuel Rowlands.</p>

  <p>Respecting Samuel Rowlands it may be regarded as extraordinary that no
  account has been discovered; and though his pamphlets almost rival in
  number those of Greene, Taylor, and Prynne, their prefaces&mdash;those
  fruitful sources of information&mdash;throw no light upon the life or
  circumstances of their author. The late Mr. Octavius Gilchrist considered
  that "Rowlands was an ecclesiastic [?] by profession;" and, inferring his
  zeal in the pulpit from his labours through the press, adds, "it should
  seem that he was an active servant of the church." (See Fry's
  <i>Bibliographical Memoranda</i>, p. 257.) Sir Walter Scott (Preface to
  his reprint of <i>The Letting of Humours Blood in the Head Vaine</i>)
  gives us a very different idea of the nature of his calling. His words
  are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Excepting that he lived and wrote, none of those industrious
  antiquaries have pointed out any particulars respecting Rowland[s]. It
  has been remarked that his muse is seldom found in the best company; and
  to have become so well acquainted with the bullies, drunkards, gamesters,
  and cheats, whom he describes, he must have frequented the haunts of
  dissipation in which such characters are to be found. But the humorous
  descriptions of low-life exhibited in his satires are more precious to
  antiquaries than more grave works, and those who make the manners of
  Shakspeare's <!-- Page 420 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page420"
  id="page420"></a>{420}</span> age the subject their study may better
  spare a better author than Samuel Rowlands."</p>

  <p>The opinions of both these writers are entitled to some respect, but
  they certainly looked upon two very different sides of the question.
  Gilchrist's conjecture that he was an ecclesiastic is quite untenable,
  and I am fully inclined to agree with Sir Walter Scott, that Rowlands'
  company was not of the most <i>select</i> order, and that he must often
  have frequented those "haunts of dissipation" which he so well describes
  in those works which are the <i>known</i> production of his muse.</p>

<h3>"APRICOT," "PEACH," AND "NECTARINE," ETYMOLOGY OF.</h3>

  <p>There is something curious in the etymology of the words "apricot,"
  "peach," and "nectarine," and in their equivalents in several languages,
  which may amuse your readers.</p>

  <p>The apricot is an Armenian or Persian fruit, and was known to the
  Romans later than the peach. It is spoken of by Pliny and by Martial.</p>

  <p>Plin. N.H., lib. xv. c. 12.:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Post autumnum maturescunt Persica, æstate <i>præcocia</i>, intra xxx
  annos reperta."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Martial, lib. xiii. Epig. 46.:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Vilia maternis fueramus <i>præcoqua</i> ramis,</p>
      <p class="i2">Nunc in adaptivis Persica care sumus."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Its only name was given from its ripening earlier than the peach.</p>

  <p>The words used in Galen for the same fruit (evidently Græcised Latin),
  are <span lang="el" title="prokokkia"
  >&#960;&#961;&#959;&#954;&#959;&#954;&#954;&#953;&#945;</span> and <span
  lang="el" title="prekokkia"
  >&#960;&#961;&#949;&#954;&#959;&#954;&#954;&#953;&#945;</span>. Elsewhere
  he says of this fruit, <span lang="el" title="tautês ekleleiphthai to palaion onoma"
  >&#964;&#945;&#965;&#964;&#951;&#962;
  &#949;&#954;&#955;&#949;&#955;&#949;&#953;&#966;&#952;&#945;&#953;
  &#964;&#959; &#960;&#945;&#955;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#957;
  &#959;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#945;</span>. Dioscorides, with a nearer
  approach to the Latin, calls apricots <span lang="el" title="praikokia."
  >&#960;&#961;&#945;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#954;&#953;&#945;.</span></p>

  <p>From <i>præcox</i>, though not immediately, <i>apricot</i> seems to be
  derived.</p>

  <p>Johnson, unable to account for the initial <i>a</i>, derives it from
  <i>apricus</i>. The American lexicographer Webster gives, strangely
  enough <i>albus coccus</i> as its derivation.</p>

  <p>The progress of the word from west to east, and then from east to
  south-west, and from thence northwards, and its various changes in that
  progress, are rather strange.</p>

  <p>One would have supposed that the Arabs, living near the region of
  which the fruit was a native, might have either had a name of their own
  for it, or at least have borrowed one from Armenia. But they apparently
  adopted a slight variation of the Latin, <span lang="el" title="to palaion onoma"
  >&#964;&#959; &#960;&#945;&#955;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#957;
  &#959;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#945;</span>, as Galen says, <span lang="el"
  title="exeleleiptô"
  >&#949;&#958;&#949;&#955;&#949;&#955;&#949;&#953;&#960;&#964;&#969;</span>.</p>

  <p>The Arabs called it <span lang="ar" title="brqwq" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#1576;&#1585;&#1602;&#1608;&#1602;</bdo></span> or, with the
  article, <span lang="ar" title="albrqwq" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#1575;&#1604;&#1576;&#1585;&#1602;&#1608;&#1602;</bdo></span>.</p>

  <p>The Spaniards must have had the fruit in Martial's time, but they do
  not take the name immediately from the Latin, but through the Arabic, and
  call it <i>albaricoque</i>. The Italians, again, copy the Spanish, not
  the Latin, and call it <i>albicocco</i>. The French, from them, have
  <i>abricot</i>. The English, though they take their word from the French,
  at first called it <i>abricock</i>, then <i>apricock</i> (restoring the
  <i>p</i>), and lastly, with the French termination, <i>apricot</i>.</p>

  <p>From <i>malum persicum</i> was derived the German <i>Pfirsiche</i>,
  and <i>Pfirsche</i>, whence come the French <i>pêche</i>, and our
  <i>peach</i>. But in this instance also, the Spaniards follow the Arabic
  <span lang="ar" title="bryshan" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#1576;&#1585;&#1610;&#1588;&#1575;&#1606;</bdo></span>, or,
  with the article <span lang="ar" title="albryshan" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#1575;&#1604;&#1576;&#1585;&#1610;&#1588;&#1575;&#1606;</bdo></span>,
  in their word <i>alberchigo</i>. The Arabic seems to be derived from the
  Latin, and the Persians, though the fruit was their own, give it the same
  name.</p>

  <p>Johnson says that nectarine is French, but gives no authority. It
  certainly is unknown to the French, who call the fruit either <i>pêche
  lisse</i>, or <i>brugnon</i>. The Germans also call it <i>glatte
  Pfirsche</i>.</p>

  <p>Can any of your readers inform me what is the Armenian word for
  <i>apricot</i>, and whether there is any reason to believe that the
  Arabic words for <i>apricot</i> and <i>peach</i>, are of Armenian and
  Persian origin? If it is so, the resemblance of the one to <i>præcox</i>,
  and of the other to <i>persicum</i>, will be a curious coincidence, but
  hardly more curious than the resemblance of <span lang="el"
  title="pascha" >&#960;&#945;&#963;&#967;&#945;</span> with <span
  lang="el" title="paschô" >&#960;&#945;&#963;&#967;&#969;</span> which led
  some of the earlier fathers, who were not Hebraists, to derive <span
  lang="el" title="pascha" >&#960;&#945;&#963;&#967;&#945;</span> from
  <span lang="el" title="paschô"
  >&#960;&#945;&#963;&#967;&#969;</span>.</p>

  means of repairing Chaucer's Monument, especially Mr. Payne Collier, who

  <p>to know that there is evidence in Smith's <i>Life of Nollekens</i>,
  vol. i. p. 79., that remains of the painted figure of Chaucer were to be
  seen in Nolleken's times. Smith reports a conversation between the artist
  and Catlin, so many years the principal verger of the abbey, in which
  Catlin inquires,</p>

  <p><i>Father Blackhal.</i>&mdash;In the <i>Brief Narration of Services
  done to Three noble Ladies by Gilbert Blackhal</i> (Aberdeen, Spalding
  Club, 1844), the autobiographer states (p. 43.) that, while at Brussels,
  he provided for his necessities by saying mass "at Notre Dame <i>de bonne
  successe</i>, a chapel of great devotion, so called from a statue of Our
  Lady, which was brought from Aberdeen to Ostend," &amp;c. It may be
  interesting to such of your readers as are acquainted with this very
  amusing volume, to know that the statue is still held in honour. A friend
  of mine (who had never heard of Blackhal) told me, that being at Brussels
  on the eve of the Assumption (Aug. 14), 1847, he saw announcements that
  the <i>Aberdeen</i> image would be carried in procession on the
  approaching festival. He was obliged, however, to leave Brussels without
  witnessing the exhibition.</p>

  <p>As to Blackhal himself, <i>The Catholic Annual Register</i> for the
  present year (p. 207.) supplies two facts which were not known to his
  editor&mdash;that he was at last principal of the Scots College at Paris,

  <p><i>Booksellers' Catalogues.</i>&mdash;Allow me to suggest the
  propriety and utility of stating the weight or cost of postage to
  second-hand and other books. It would be a great convenience to many
  country book-buyers to know the entire cost, carriage-free, of the
  volumes they require, but have never seen.</p>

  <p><i>Bailie Nicol Jarvie.</i>&mdash;Lockhart, in his <i>Life of

<blockquote>
  <p>"The great and unrivalled attraction was the personification of Bailie
  Jarvie by Charles Mackay, who, being himself a native of Glasgow, entered
  into the minutest peculiarities of the character with high <i>gusto</i>,
  and gave the west country dialect in its most racy perfection."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>But in the sweetest cup of praise, there is generally one small drop
  of bitterness. The drop, in honest Mackay's case, is that by calling him
  a "native of Glasgow," and, therefore, "to the manner born," he is, by
  implication, deprived of the credit of speaking the "foreign tongue" like
  a native. So after wearing his laurels for a quarter of a century with
  this one withered leaf in them, he has plucked it off, and by a formal
  affidavit sworn before an Edinburgh bailie, the Glasgow bailie has put it
  on record that he is really by birth "one of the same class whom King
  Jamie denominated a real Edinburgh Gutter-Bluid." If there is something
  droll in the notion of such an affidavit, there is, assuredly, something
  to move our respect in the earnestness and love of truth which led the
  bailie to make it, and to prove him a good honest man, as we have no
  doubt, "his father, the deacon, was before him."</p>

<h2>QUERIES.</h2>

<h3>BIBLIOGRAPHICAL QUERIES.</h3>

  <p>(<i>Continued from page 325.</i>)</p>

  <p>(13.) Is it not a grievous and calumnious charge against the principal
  libraries of England, Germany, and France, that not one of them contains
  a copy of the <i>Florentine Pandects</i>, in three folio <!-- Page 422
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page422" id="page422"></a>{422}</span>
  volumes, "magnifice, ac pereleganter, perque accurate impressis," as
  Fabricius speaks? (<i>Bibl. Græc.</i> xii: 363.) This statement, which
  may be but a libel, is found in Tilgner (<i>Nov. lib. rar. Collect.</i>
  Fascic. iv. 710.), Schelhorn (<i>Amæn. Lit.</i> iii. 428.), Vogt
  (<i>Catal.</i> p. 562. Hamb. 1738), and Solger (<i>Biblioth.</i> i 163.).
  According to the last writer, the edition in question, Florent. 1553,
  (for a fac-simile of the letters of the original MS. see Mabillon's
  <i>Iter Italicum</i>, p. 183.) is,&mdash;"splendidissima, et stupendæ
  raritatis, quæ in tanta est apud Eruditos æstimatione ut pro 100
  Imperialibus sæpius divendita fuerit." Would that the race of such
  purchasers was not extinct! In Gibbon's notice of this impression
  (<i>Decline and Fall</i>, iv. 197. ed. Milman), there are two mistakes.
  He calls the editor "Taurellus" instead of <i>Taurellius</i>; and makes
  the date "1551", when it should have been 1553. These errors, however,
  are scarcely surprising in a sentence in which Antonius Augustinus is
  named "Antoninus." The Archbishop of Tarragona had received a still more
  exalted title in p. 193., for there he was styled "Antoninus Augustus."
  Are these the author's faults, or are they merely editorial
  embellishments?</p>

  <p>(14.) In what year was the improved woodcut of the <i>Prelum
  Ascensianum</i> used for the first time? And has it been observed that
  the small and separated figures incised on the legs of this
  <i>insigne</i> of Jodocus Badius may sometimes be taken as a safe guide
  with reference to the exact date of the works in which this mark appears?
  As an argument serving to justify the occasional adoption of this
  criterion I would adduce the fact, that the earliest edition of Budæus
  <i>De Contemptu Rerum fortuitarum</i> is believed to have been printed in
  1520 (Greswell's <i>Parisian Greek Press</i>, i. 39.), and this year is
  accordingly visible in the title-page on the print of the <i>Prelum
  Ascensianum</i>. That recourse must, however, be had with caution to this
  method of discovering a date, is manifest; from the circumstance, that
  1521, or perhaps I should say an injured 1520, appears on the Badian
  Device in the third impression of the same treatise (the second with the
  <i>expositio</i>), though it was set forth "postridie Cal. April
  1528."</p>

  <p>(15.) Is it owing to the extreme rarity of copies of the first edition
  of the Pagninian version of the Scriptures that so many writers are
  perplexed and ignorant concerning it? One might have expected that such a
  very remarkable impression in all respects would have been so well known
  to Bishop Walton, that he could not have asserted (<i>Proleg.</i> v.)
  that it was published in 1523; and the same hallucination is perceptible
  in the <i>Elenchus Scriptorum</i> by Crowe (p. 4.) It is certain that
  Pope Leo X. directed that Pagnini's translation should be printed at his
  expense (Roscoe, ii. 282.), and the Diploma of Adrian VI. is dated "die,
  xj. Maij. M.D.XXIII.," but the labours of the eminent Dominican were not
  put forth until the 29th of January, 1527. This is the date in the
  colophon; and though "1528" is obvious on the title-page, the apparent
  variation may be accounted for by remembering the several ways of marking
  the commencement of the year. (<i>Le Long</i>, by Masch, ii. 475.;
  <i>Chronol. of Hist.</i>, by Sir H. Nicolas, p. 40.) Chevillier informs
  us (<i>Orig. de l'Imp.</i> p. 143.) that the earliest Latin Bible, in
  which he had seen the verses distinguished by ciphers, was that of Robert
  Stephens in 1557. Clement (<i>Biblioth.</i> iv. 147.) takes notice of an
  impression issued two years previously; and these bibliographers have
  been followed by Greswell (<i>Paris. G. P.</i> i. 342. 390.). Were they
  all unacquainted with the antecedent exertions of Sante Pagnini (See
  Pettigrew's <i>Bibl. Sussex.</i> p. 388.)</p>

  <p>(16.) Why should Panzer have thought that the true date of the
  <i>editio princeps</i> of Gregorius Turonensis and Ado Viennensis,
  comprised in the same small folio volume, was 1516? (Greswell, i. 35.) If
  he had said 1522, he might have had the assistance of a misprint in the
  colophon, in which "M.D.XXII." was inserted instead of M.D.XII.; but the
  royal privilege for the book is dated, "le douziesme iour de mars lan
  <i>milcinqcens et onze</i>," and the dedication of the works by Badius to
  Guil. Parvus ends with "Ad. XII Kalendas Decemb. Anni huius M.D.XII."</p>

  <p>(17.) Who was the author of <i>Peniteas cito</i>? And is it not
  evident that the impression at Cologne by Martinus de Werdena, in 1511,
  is considerably later than that which is adorned on the title-page with a
  different woodcut, and which exhibits the following words proceeding from
  the teacher: "Accipies tanti doctoris dogmata sancta?"</p>

  <p>DRYDEN'S "ESSAY UPON SATIRE."</p>

  <p>On what evidence does the statement rest, that the Earl of Mulgrave
  was the author of the <i>Essay upon Satire</i>, and that Dryden merely
  corrected and polished it? As at present advised, I have considerable
  doubt upon the point: and although, in modern editions of Dryden's
  <i>Works</i>, I find it headed <i>An Essay upon Satire, written by Mr.
  Dryden and the Earl of Mulgrave</i>, yet in the <i>State Poems</i>, vol.
  i. p. 179., originally printed in the lifetime of Dryden, it is
  attributed solely to him&mdash;"<i>An Essay upon Satyr.</i> By J. Dryden,
  Esq." This gets rid of the assertion in the note of "D.," in the Aldine
  edition of Dryden (i. 105.), that "the Earl of Mulgrave's name has been
  <i>always</i> joined with Dryden's, as concerned in the composition." Was
  it not first published without notice that any other person was concerned
  in it but Dryden?</p>

  <p>The internal evidence, too, is strong that Dryden was the author of
  it. I do not here refer to the <!-- Page 423 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page423" id="page423"></a>{423}</span> free, flexible, and
  idiomatic character of the versification, so exactly like that of Dryden;
  but principally to the description the <i>Essay upon Satire</i> contains
  of the Earl of Mulgrave himself, beginning,</p>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Mulgrave had much ado to scape the snare,</p>
      <p>Though learn'd in those ill arts that cheat the fair;</p>
      <p>For, after all, his vulgar marriage mocks,</p>
      <p>With beauty dazzled Numps was in the stocks;"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>And ending:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Him no soft thoughts, no gratitude could move;</p>
      <p>To gold he fled, from beauty and from love," &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Could Mulgrave have so written of himself; or could he have allowed
  Dryden to interpolate the character. Earlier in the poem we meet with a
  description of Shaftesbury, which cannot fail to call to mind Dryden's
  character of him in <i>Absalom and Achitophel</i>; which, as we know, did
  not make its appearance, even in its first shape, until two years after
  Dryden was cudgelled in Rose Street as <i>the author</i> of the <i>Essay
  upon Satire</i>. Everybody bears in mind the triplet,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"A fiery soul, which working out its way,</p>
      <p>Fretted his pigmy body to decay,</p>
      <p>And o'er-inform'd the tenement of clay;"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>And what does Dryden (for it must be he who writes) say of Shaftesbury
  in the <i>Essay upon Satire</i>?</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"As by our little Machiavel we find,</p>
      <p>That nimblest creature of the busy kind:</p>
      <p>His limbs are crippled, and his body shakes,</p>
      <p>Yet his hard mind, which all this bustle makes,</p>
      <p>No pity on its poor companion takes."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>If Mulgrave wrote these lines, and Dryden only corrected them, Dryden
  was at all events indebted to Mulgrave for the thought of the inequality,
  and disproportion between the mind and body of Shaftesbury. Moreover, we
  know that Pope expunged the assertion subsequently made, that Dryden had
  been "punished" (not <i>beaten</i>, as "D." quotes the passage) "for
  another's rhimes," when he was bastinadoed, in 1679, at the instigation
  of Rochester, for the character of him in the <i>Essay upon
  Satire</i>.</p>

  <p>It might suit Mulgrave's purpose afterwards to claim a share in this
  production; but the evidence, as far as I am acquainted with it, seems
  all against it. There may be much evidence on the point with which I am
  not acquainted, and perhaps some of your readers will be so good as to
  point it out to me. The question is one that I am, at this moment,
  especially interested in.</p>

<h3>MINOR QUERIES.</h3>

  <p><i>Æneas Silvius (Pope Pius II.).</i>&mdash;A broadsheet was published
  in 1461, containing the excommunication and dethronement of the
  Archbishop and Elector Dietrich of Mayence, issued and styled in the most
  formidable terms by <i>Pius II.</i> This broadsheet, consisting of
  eighteen lines, and printed on one side only, appears from the uniformity
  of its type with the <i>Rationale</i> of 1459, to be the product of
  <i>Fust</i> and <i>Schöffer</i>.</p>

  <p>No mention whatever is made of this typographical curiosity in any of
  the standard bibliographical manuals, from which it seems, that this
  broadsheet is UNIQUE. Can any information, throwing light upon this
  subject, be given?</p>

  <p class="author">QUERIST.</p>

  <p>November, 1850.</p>

  <p>"<i>Please the Pigs</i>" is a phrase too vulgarly common not to be
  well known to your readers. But whence has it arisen? Either in "NOTES
  AND QUERIES," or elsewhere, it has been explained as a corruption of
  "Please the <i>pix</i>." Will you allow another suggestion? I think it
  possible that the pigs of the Gergesenes (Matthew viii. 28. <i>et
  seq.</i>) may be those appealed to, and that the invocation may be of
  somewhat impious meaning. John Bradford, the martyr of 1555, has within a
  few consecutive pages of his writings the following expressions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"And so by this means, as they save their pigs, which they would not
  lose, (I mean their worldly pelf), so they would please the Protestants,
  and be counted with them for gospellers, yea, marry, would
  they."&mdash;<i>Writings of Bradford</i>, Parker Society ed., p.390.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Again:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Now are they willing to drink of God's cup of afflictions, which He
  offereth common with His son Christ our Lord, lest they should love their
  pigs with the Gergenites." p. 409.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Again:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"This is a hard sermon: 'Who is able to abide it?' Therefore, Christ
  must be prayed to depart, lest all their pigs be drowned. The devil shall
  have his dwelling again in themselves, rather than in their pigs." p.
  409.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>These, and similar expressions in the same writer, without reference
  to any text upon the subject, seem to show, that men loving their pigs
  more than God, was a theological phrase of the day, descriptive of their
  too great worldliness. Hence, just as St. Paul said, "if the Lord will,"
  or as we say, "please God," or, as it is sometimes written, "D.V.,"
  worldly men would exclaim, "please the pigs," and thereby mean that,
  provided it suited their present interest, they would do this or that
  thing.</p>

<h2>REPLIES.</h2>

<h3>LICENSING OF BOOKS.</h3>

<p class="center">(Vol. ii., p.359.)</p>

  <p>On the 12th November, 5 &amp; 6 Philip and Mary, 1558, a bill "That no
  man shall print any book or ballad, &amp;c., unless he be authorized
  thereunto by the king and queen's majesties licence, under the Great Seal
  of Englande," was read for the first time in the House of Lords, where it
  was read again a second time on the 14th. On the 16th it was read for the
  third time, but it did not pass, and probably never reached the Commons;
  for Queen Mary died on the following day, and thereby the Parliament was
  dissolved. (<i>Lords' Journal</i>, i. 539, 540.) Queen Elizabeth, however
  did by her high prerogative what her sister had sought to effect by
  legislative sanction. In the first year of her reign, 1559, she issued
  injunctions concerning both the clergy and the laity: the 51st Injunction
  was in the following terms:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Item, because there is great abuse in the printers of books, which
  for covetousness chiefly regard not what they print, so they may have
  gain, whereby ariseth the great disorder by publication of unfruitful,
  vain, and infamous books and papers; the queen's majesty straitly
  chargeth and commandeth, that no manner of person shall print any manner
  of book or paper, of what sort, nature, or in what language soever it be,
  except the same be first licensed by Her Majesty by express words in
  writing, or by six of her privy council; or be perused and licensed by
  the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, the Bishop of London, the
  chancellors of both universities, the bishop being ordinary, and the
  archdeacon also of the place, where any such shall be printed, or by two
  of them, whereof the ordinary of the place to be always one. And that the
  names of such, as shall allow the same, to be added in the end of every
  such work, for a testimony of the allowance thereof. And because many
  pamphlets, plays, and ballads be oftentimes printed, wherein regard would
  be had that nothing therein should be either heretical, seditious, or
  unseemly for Christian ears; Her Majesty likewise commandeth that no
  manner of person shall enterprise to print any such, except the same be
  to him licensed by such Her Majesty's commissioners, or three of them, as
  be appointed in the city of London to hear and determine divers clauses
  ecclesiastical, tending to the execution of certain statutes made the
  last parliament for uniformity of order in religion. And if any shall
  sell or utter any manner of books or papers, being not licensed as is
  abovesaid, that the same party shall be punished by order of the said
  commissioners, as to the quality of the fault shall be thought meet. And
  touching all other books of matters of religion, or policy, or
  governance, that have been printed, either on this side the seas, or on
  the other side, because the diversity of them is great, and that there
  needeth good consideration to be had of the particularities thereof, Her
  Majesty referreth the prohibition or permission thereof to the order,
  which her said commissioners within the city of London shall take and
  notify. According to the which, Her Majesty straitly chargeth and
  commandeth all manner her subjects, and especially the wardens and
  company of stationers, to be obedient.</p>

  <p>"Provided that these orders do not extend to any profane authors and
  works in any language, that have been heretofore commonly received or
  allowed in any of the universities or schools, but the same may be
  printed, and used as by good order they were
  accustomed."&mdash;Cardswell's <i>Documentary Annals</i>, i. 229.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This injunction was, I take it, the origin of the licensing of the
  press of this country. On the 23d June, 28 Eliz. 1586 (not 1585, as in
  Strype), <!-- Page 426 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page426"
  id="page426"></a>{426}</span> Archbishop Whitgift and the Lords of the
  Privy Council in the Star Chamber made rules and ordinances for
  redressing abuses in printing. No printing-press was to be allowed
  elsewhere than in London (except one in each University); and no book was
  to be printed until first seen and perused by the Archbishop of
  Canterbury or Bishop of London; with an exception in favour of the
  queen's printer, and books of the common law, which were to be allowed by
  the Chief Justices and Chief Baron, or one of them. Extensive and
  arbitrary powers of search for unlicensed books and presses were also
  given to the wardens of the Stationers' Company. (Strype's <i>Life of
  Archbishop Whitgift</i>, 222.; Records, No.XXIV.) On the 1st July, 1637,
  another decree of a similar character was made by the Court of Star
  Chamber. (Rushworth's <i>Historical Collections</i>, Part ii. p.450.) The
  Long Parliament, although it dissolved the Star Chamber, seems to have
  had no more enlightened views as respects the freedom of the press than
  Queen Elizabeth or the Archbishops Whitgift and Laud; for on the 14th
  June, 1643, the two Houses made an ordinance prohibiting the printing of
  any order or declaration of either House, without order of one or both
  Houses; or the printing or sale of any book, pamphlet, or paper, unless
  the same were approved and licensed under the hands of such persons as
  both or either House should appoint for licensing the same.
  (<i>Parliamentary History</i>, xii. 298.) The names of the licensers
  appointed are given in Neal's <i>History of the Puritans</i> (ed. 1837,
  ii. 205.). It was this ordinance which occasioned the publication, in or
  about 1644, of Milton's most noble defence of the liberty of the press,
  entitled <i>Areopagitica; a Speech for the Liberty of unlicensed
  Printing, To the Parliament of England</i>. After setting out certain
  Italian imprimaturs, he remarks:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"These are the pretty responsories, these are the dear antiphonies
  that so bewitched of late our prelates and their chaplains with the godly
  echo they made and besotted, as to the gay imitation of a lordly
  imprimatur, one from Lambeth House, another from the west end of Paul's;
  so apishly romanising, that the word of command still was set down in
  Latin, as if the learned grammatical pen that wrote it would cast no ink
  without Latin; or, perhaps, as they thought, because no vulgar tongue was
  worthy to express the pure conceit of an imprimatur; but rather, as I
  hope, for that our English, the language of men ever famous and foremost
  in the achievements of liberty, will not easily find servile letters enow
  to spell such a dictatory presumption englished."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>On the 28th September, 1647, the Lords and Commons passed a still more
  severe ordinance, which imposed pains and penalties on all persons
  printing, publishing, selling, or uttering any book, pamphlet, treatise,
  ballad, libel, or sheet of news, without the licence of both, or either
  House of Parliament, or such persons as should be thereunto authorised by
  one or both Houses. Offending hawkers, pedlars, and ballad-chappers were
  to be whipped as common rogues. (<i>Parliamentary History</i>, xvi. 309.)
  We get some insight into the probable cause of this ordinance from a
  letter of Sir Thomas Fairfax to the Earl of Manchester, dated "Putney,
  20th Sept., 1647." He complains of some printed pamphlets, very
  scandalous and abusive, to the army in particular, and the whole kingdom
  in general; and expresses his desire that these, and all of the like
  nature, might be suppressed for the future. In order, however, to satisfy
  the kingdom's expectation for intelligence, he advises that, till a firm
  peace be settled, two or three sheets might be permitted to come out
  weekly, which might be licensed; and as Mr. Mabbott had approved himself
  faithful in that service of licensing, and likewise in the service of the
  House and the army, he requested that he might be continued in the said
  place of licenser. (<i>Lords' Journals</i>, ix. 457.) Gilbert Mabbott was
  accordingly appointed licenser of such weekly papers as should be
  printed, but resigned the situation 22nd May, 1649. (<i>Commons'
  Journals</i>, vi. 214.) It seems he had conscientious objections to the
  service, for elsewhere it is recorded, under the same date, "Upon Mr.
  Mabbott's desire and reasons against licensing of books to be printed, he
  was discharged of that imployment." (Whitelock's <i>Memorials</i>, 389.)
  On the 20th September, 1649, was passed a parliamentary ordinance
  prohibiting printing elsewhere than in London, the two Universities,
  York, and Finsbury, without the licence of the Council of State
  (Scobell's <i>Ordinances</i>, Part ii. 90.); and on the 7th January,
  1652-3, the Parliament passed another ordinance for the suppression of
  unlicensed and scandalous books. (Scobell's <i>Ordinances</i>, Part ii.
  231.) In 1661 a bill for the regulation of printing passed the Lords, but
  was rejected by the Commons on account of the peers having inserted a
  clause exempting their own houses from search; but in 1662 was passed the
  statute 13 &amp; 14 Car. II. c. 33., which required all books to be
  licensed as follows:&mdash;Law books by the Lord Chancellor, or one of
  the Chief Justices, or Chief Baron; books of history and state, by one of
  the Secretaries of State; of heraldry, by the Earl Marshal, or the
  King-at-Arms; of divinity, physic, philosophy, or whatsoever other
  science or art, by the Archbishop of Canterbury or the Bishop of London:
  or if printed at either University, by the chancellor thereof. The number
  of master printers (exclusive of the king's printers and the printers of
  the Universities) was to be reduced to twenty, and then vacancies were to
  be filled up by the Archbishop of Canterbury and Bishop of London, and
  printing was not to be allowed elsewhere than in London, York (where the
  Archbishop of York was to license all books), <!-- Page 427 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page427" id="page427"></a>{427}</span> and the
  two Universities. This Act was to continue for two years, from 10th June,
  1662. It was renewed by the 16 Car. II. c. 8.; 16 &amp; 17 Car. II. c.
  7.; and 17 Car. II. c. 4., and expired on the 26th May, 1679,&mdash;a day
  rendered ever memorable by the passing of the Habeas Corpus Act: but in
  less than a year afterwards the judges unanimously advised the king that
  he might by law prohibit the printing and publishing of all news-books
  and pamphlets of news not licensed by His Majesty's authority; and
  accordingly on the 17th May, 1680, appeared in the <i>Gazette</i> a
  proclamation restraining the printing of such books and pamphlets without
  license. The Act of 1662 was revived for seven years, from 24th June,
  1685, by 1 Jac. II. c. 17. s. 15., and, even after the Revolution, was
  continued for a year longer by 4 &amp; 5 Wm. and Mary, c. 24. s. 14. When
  that year expired, the press of England became free; but on the 1st of
  April, 1697, the House of Commons, after passing a vote against John
  Salusbury, printer of the <i>Flying Post</i>, for a paragraph inserted in
  that journal tending to destroy the credit and currency of Exchequer
  Bills, ordered that leave should be given to bring in a bill to prevent
  the writing, printing, and publishing any news without licence. Mr.
  Poultney accordingly presented such a bill on the 3rd of April. It was
  read a first time; but a motion to read it a second time was negatived.
  (<i>Commons' Journals</i>, xi. 765. 767.) This attempt again to shackle

<h3>REMAINS OF JAMES II.</h3>

<p class="center">(Vol. ii., pp. 243. 281.)</p>

  <p>To the information which has recently been furnished in your pages
  respecting the remains of James II., it may be not uninteresting to add
  the inscription which is on his monument in the church of St.
  Germain-en-Laye, and which I copied, on occasion of my last visit to
  France.</p>

  <p>The body of the king, or a considerable portion of it, which had
  remained unburied, was, I believe, interred at St. Germain soon after the
  termination of the war in 1814; but it being necessary to rebuild the
  church, the remains were exhumed and re-interred in 1824. Vicissitudes as
  strange in death as in life seem to have attended this unhappy king.</p>

  <p>The following is the inscription <i>now</i> on his monument in the
  parish church of St. Germain:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"REGIO CINERI PIETAS REGIA.</p>

      <p class="i2">Jacobus 2. Anglorum Rex.</p>

      <p class="i2">Pio placidoque obitu exsolvit</p>
      <p class="i4">in hac urbe</p>
      <p class="i2">Die 16. Septemb. anni 1701.</p>
      <p>Et nobiliores quædam corporis ejus partes</p>
      <p class="i2">Hic reconditæ asservantur."</p>

      <p>Verum laus fidei ac morum haud peritura manebit</p>
      <p>Tu quoque summe Deus regem quem regius hospes</p>
      <p>Infaustum excepit tecum regnare jubebis."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>But a different inscription formerly was placed over the king's
  remains in this church, which has now disappeared; at all events, I could
  not discover it; and I suppose that the foregoing was preferred and
  substituted for that, a copy of which I subjoin:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"D.O.M. Jussu Georgii IV. Magnæ Britanniæ &amp;c., Regis, et curante
  Equite exc. Carolo Stuart Regis Britanniæ Legato, cæteris antea rite
  peractis et quo decet honore in stirpem Regiam hic nuper effossæ
  reconditæ sunt Reliquiæ Jacobi II., qui in secundo civitatis gradu clarus
  triumphis in primo infelicior, post varios fortunæ casus in spem melioris
  vitæ et beatæ resurrectionis hic quievit in Domino, anno MDCCI, v. idus
  Septemb., MDCCCXXIV."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>At the foot of the monument were the words&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Depouilles mortelles de Jacques 2. Roi d'Angleterre."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>A third monumental inscription to the memory of James II., in Latin,
  is to be seen in the chapel of the Scotch College in Paris. This memorial
  was erected in 1703, by James, Duke of Perth. An urn, containing the
  brains of the king, formerly stood on the top of it. A copy of this
  inscription is preserved in the <i>Collectanea Topographica et
  Genealogica</i>, vol. vii.</p>

<h3>JUDGE CRADOCK.</h3>

  <p>My transplantation from Gloucester to Devonshire, and the consequent
  unapproachable state of my books, prevents my referring to authorities at
  the moment in support of what I have said about the arms of Judge Cradock
  <i>alias</i> Newton: still I wish to notice the subject at once that I
  may not appear to shrink from the Query of S.A.Y. (Vol. ii., p. 371.)</p>

  <p>I happen to have at hand a copy of the Grant <!-- Page 428 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page428" id="page428"></a>{428}</span> of Arms
  to Sir John of East Harptree, Somerset, in 1567 in which, on the
  authority of the heralds of the day, arg. on a chevron az. 3 garbs or,
  are granted to him in the first quarter as the arms of Robert Cradock
  <i>alias</i> Newton. The Judge seems to have been the first of the family
  who dropped the name of Cradock. His forefathers, for several generations
  (from Howel ap Grononye, who was Lord of Newton, in Rouse or Trenewith,
  in Poursland), went by the name of Cradog Dom. de Newton.</p>

  <p>Robert Cradock, mentioned in the Grant I have quoted, married Margaret
  Sherborne. He was the Judge's great-great-grandfather. Sir John Newton,
  to whom the grant was made, lies buried at East Harptree; and on his tomb
  may be seen (besides his effigies as large as life) the twelve
  quarterings in their original (?) blazoning, impaled with those of his
  wife, one of the Pointz family. The same arms (of Newton) are still
  discernible on a beautifully wrought, though now much mutilated shield,
  over one of the doors of Barres Court, at East Hanham, in Bitton,
  Gloucestershire, where Newton also had a residence, where John Leland on
  his itinerary visited him, and says (<i>Itin.</i> vol. vii. p. 87.) "his
  very propre name is Caradoc," &amp;c. This property Newton inherited as a
  descendant from the De Bittons or Button (through Hampton), a family of
  great note in their day, and residents on the site of Barres Court, a
  "fayr manner place of stone," which evidently took its name from Sir John
  Barre, who married Joan, the relict of Robert Greyndon, and daughter of
  Thomas Roug by Catherine, who was the last heiress of that branch of De
  Bittons&mdash;(she died 1485, and is buried with her first husband at
  Newlond). Of the same family were the three bishops of that name, in the
  reigns of the early Edwards; one of which, <i>Thomas</i>, Bishop of
  Exeter in 1299, was the pious founder of a chantry chapel adjoining
  Bitton Church, over the bodies of his father and another, who were buried
  there; the building itself is quite an architectural gem. The said bishop
  must also have resided there, for in 1287, when Dean of Wells, the Lord
  of the Manor of that part of Bitton where his estate lay, impounded some
  of his cattle, and had a trial thereon at Gloucester, as appears by a
  Placite Roll of that date.</p>

  <p>I send you a copy of the Grant of Arms, as it may be interesting, to
  publish&mdash;besides, it is a reply to the latter part of S.A.Y.'s
  Query. It is copied from the Ashmol. MSS. No. 834. p. 34.</p>

  <p>Of the Newtons of Yorkshire I know nothing; but if S.A.Y. wishes to
  question me further, I shall be happy to receive his communication under
  his own proper sign-manual.</p>

  <p>In Nichols' <i>Leicestershire</i>, vol. iv. pt. 2. p. 807., is a
  pedigree of Cradock bearing the same arms, and it is there laid down that
  Howel ap Gronow was slain by the French in 1096, and buried at Llandilo
  Vawr; also that the Judge was called Newton from his birth-place. (It is
  in Montgomeryshire, I believe.) Matthew Cradock, who lies in Swansea
  Church, bore different arms.</p>

  <p><i>On a Passage in "The Tempest"</i> (Vol. ii., pp. 259. 299.
  337.).&mdash;Will you allow me to suggest that the reading of the
  original edition is perfectly correct as it stands, as will be seen by
  simply italicising the emphatic words:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"<i>Most</i> busie <i>least</i>, when I doe it."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The construction is thus merely an instance of a common ellipsis (here
  of the word <i>busy</i>), and requires the comma after <i>least</i>. This
  is another proof of the advantage of being slow to abandon primitive
  texts.</p>

  <p class="author">GEORGE STEPHENS.</p>

  <p><i>Saint, Legend of a</i> (Vol. ii., pp. 267.).&mdash;The circumstance
  alluded to is perhaps that in the legend of <i>St. Patrick</i>. It was
  included by Voragine in his life of that saint. See the "Golden Legend"
  in init.</p>

  <p class="author">GEORGE STEPHENS.</p>

  <p><i>Cupid and Psyche</i> (Vol. ii., pp. 247.).&mdash;This is probably
  an old <i>Folk-tale</i>, originally perhaps an antique philosophical
  temple-allegory. Apuleius appears only to have dressed it up in a new
  shape. The tale is still current, but in a form <i>not</i> derived from
  him, among the <i>Swedes</i>, <i>Norwegians</i>, <i>Danes</i>,
  <i>Scots</i>, <i>Germans</i>, <i>French</i>, <i>Wallachians</i>,
  <i>Italians</i>, and <i>Hindoos</i>. See <i>Svenska Folk-sagor och

  <p><i>Kongs Skuggsia</i> (Vol. ii., pp 296. 335.).&mdash;This noble

  remain unknown, in which he has perfectly succeeded. He probably resided
  near Trondhjem. See, for other information, the preface to the last

  <p><i>The disputed Passage in the "Tempest"</i> (Vol. ii., pp. 259. 299.
  337.).&mdash;I am the "COMMA" which MR. COLLIER claims the merit of
  having removed, and I humbly protest against the removal. I adhere to the
  reading of the folio of 1632, except that I would strike out the final
  <i>s</i> in labours. The passage would then read:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"But these sweet thoughts so refresh my labour</p>
      <p>Most busy least, when I do it."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>That is, the thoughts so refresh my labour, that I am "most busy
  least" (an emphatic way of saying least busy), "when I do it," to wit,
  the labour. MR. HICKSON is ingenious, but he takes no notice
  of&mdash;</p>

  <p class="author">COMMA.</p>

  <p><i>Viscount Castlecomer</i> (Vol. ii., p. 376.).&mdash;S.A.Y. asks
  whether Lord Deputy Wandesford (not Wanderforde) "ever took up this
  title, and what became of it afterwards?" He never did; for on the
  receipt of the patent, in the summer of 1640, Wandesford exclaimed, "Is
  this a time for a faithful subject to be exalted, when his king, the
  fountain of honours, is likely to be reduced lower than ever." A few
  months afterwards he died of a broken heart. We are told that he
  concealed the patent, and his grandson was the first of the
  family&mdash;apparently by a fresh creation in 1706&mdash;who assumed the
  title. The neglect of sixty-six years, perhaps, rendered this necessary:
  Beatson does not notice the first creation. The life of this active and
  useful statesman, the friend and relative of Strafford, was compiled from
  his daughter's papers, by his descendant, Thomas Comber, LL.D. Of this
  work Dr. Whitaker availed himself in the very interesting memoir which he
  has given of the Lord Deputy, in his <i>History of Richmondshire</i>,
  written, as we may suppose it would be by so devoted <!-- Page 430

  an admirer of Charles I., with the warmest feelings of respect and
  admiration.</p>

  <p>"The death of my cousin Wandesford," said Lord Strafford, "more
  affects me than the prospect of my own; for in him is lost the richest
  magazine of learning, wisdom, and piety that these times could
  boast."</p>

  <p><i>Steele's Burial-place</i> (Vol. ii., pp. 375, 441.).&mdash;I have
  been able to get the following particulars respecting Steele's
  burial-place. Steele was buried in the chancel of St. Peter's church,
  Caermarthen. The entry stands thus in the Register:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"1729.</p>
      <p>"Sep. 4. S<sup>r</sup> Richard Steel."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>There is no monument to his memory in St. Peter's Church; but in
  Llangunnor church, about two miles from Caermarthen, there is a plain
  monumental tablet with the following inscription:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"This stone was erected at the instance of William Williams, of Ivy
  Tower, owner of Penddaylwn Vawr, in Llangunnor; part of the estate there
  once belonging to the deservedly celebrated Sir Richard Steele, knight,
  chief author of the essays named Tatlers, Guardians, and Spectators; and
  he wrote The Christian Hero, The Englishman, and The Crisis, The
  Conscious Lovers, and other fine plays. He represented several places in
  parliament; was a staunch and able patriot; finally, an incomparable
  writer on morality and Christianity. Hence the ensuing lines in a poem,
  called The Head of the Rock:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>'Behold Llangunnor, leering o'er the vale,</p>
      <p>Pourtrays a scene t' adorn romantic tale;</p>
      <p>But more than all the beauties of its site,</p>
      <p>Its former owner gives the mind delight.</p>
      <p>Is there a heart that can't affection feel</p>
      <p>For lands so rich as once to boast a Steele?</p>
      <p>Who warm for freedom, and with virtue fraught,</p>
      <p>His country dearly lov'd, and greatly taught;</p>
      <p>Whose morals pure, the purest style conveys,</p>
      <p>T' instruct his Britain to the last of days.'"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</blockquote>

  <p>Steele resided at White House (Ty Gwyn, as it is called in Welsh), a
  clean farm-house half way between Caermarthen and Llangunnor church,
  which is situate on a hill commanding extensive views of one of the
  prettiest values in Wales. A field near the house is pointed out as the
  site of Steele's garden, in the bower of which he is said to have written
  his "Conscious Lovers." The Ivy Bush, formerly a private house, and said
  to be the house where Steele died, is now the principal inn in
  Caermarthen.</p>

  <p><i>Cure for Warts</i> (Vol. i., p. 482.)&mdash; In Buckinghamshire I
  have heard of the charming away of warts by touching each wart with a
  separate green pea. Each pea being wrapped in paper by itself, and
  buried, the wart will vanish as the pea decays.</p>

  <p class="author">J.W.H.</p>

  <p><i>Etymology of "Parse"</i> (Vol. ii., p. 118.).&mdash;Surely <i>to
  parse</i> is to take by itself each <i>pars</i>, or part of speech. The
  word does not seem to have been known in 1611 when Brinsley published his
  <i>Posing of the Parts: or, a most plain and easie Way of examining the
  Accidence and Grammar</i>. This work appears to have been very popular,
  as I have by me the <i>twelfth</i> edition, London, 1669. In 1612, the
  same author issued his <i>Ludus Literarius: or the Grammar Schoole</i>.
  Both these works interest me in him. Can any of your readers communicate
  any particulars of his history?</p>

  <p>Admiration of the works of Holbein in Germany, as in this country,
  seems to increase with increasing years. We have received from Messrs.
  Williams and Norgate a copy of a new edition of his Bible Cuts lately
  published at Leipsic, under the title <i>Hans Holbein's Altes Testament
  in funfzig Holzschnitten getreu nach den Originalen copirt. Herausgegeben
  von Hugo Burkner, mit einer Einleitung von D.F. Sotymann</i>, to which we

  fidelity with which these admirable specimens of Holbein's genius have
  been copied, than of the interesting account of them prefixed by their
  new editor.</p>

  <p>We beg to call the attention of such of our antiquaries as are
  interested in the history of the Orkneys to a valuable contribution to
  our knowledge of them, lately published by our accomplished friend,

  Historiam Antiquiorem Rerum Norwegicarum</i>, which contains, I. A short
  Chronicle of Norway; II. Genealogy of the Earls of Orkney; III. Catalogue
  of the Kings of Norway&mdash;from a MS., for the most part hitherto
  inedited, and which appears to have been written in Orkney about the
  middle of the fifteenth century.</p>

  <p>While on the subject of foreign works of interest to English readers,
  we may mention two or three others which we have been for some time
  intending to bring under the notice of those who know how much light may
  be thrown upon our early language and literature by a study of the
  contemporary literature of the Low Countries. The first is, <i>Denkmaeler
  Niederdeutscher Sprache und Literatur von Dr. Albert Hoefer, Erstes
  Banchen</i>, which contains the highly curious Low German Whitson play
  called <i>Claws Bur</i>. The next is a larger, more elaborately edited,
  and from its introduction and extensive notes and various illustrations,
  a yet more interesting work to English philologists. It is entitled
  <i>Leven van Sinte Christina de Wonderbare</i>, an old Dutch poem, now
  first edited from a MS. of the fourteenth or fifteenth century, by
  Professor Bormans.</p>

  FIRST SERIES, and a SECOND EDITION of the SECOND SERIES, price 7<i>s.</i>
  6<i>d.</i> each.</p>

  <p>"Their style is simple; the sentences are not artfully constructed;
  and there is an utter absence of all attempt at rhetoric. The language is
  plain Saxton language, from which 'the men on the wall' can easily gather
  what it most concerns them to know.</p>

  <p>"Again, the range of thought is not high and difficult, but level and
  easy for the wayfaring man to follow. It is quite evident that the
  author's mind was able and cultivated; yet as a teacher to men of low
  estate, he makes no displays of eloquence or argument.</p>

  <p>"In the statements of Christian doctrine the reality of Mr. Blencowe's
  mind is very striking. There is a strength, and a warmth, and a life, in
  his mention of the great truths of the Gospel, which show that he spoke
  from the heart, and that, like the Apostle of old, he could say&mdash;'I
  believe, and therefore have I spoken.'</p>

  <p>"His affectionateness too is no less conspicuous; this is shown in the
  gentle, earnest, kind-hearted tone of every Sermon in the book. There is
  no scolding, no asperity of language, no irritation of manner about them.
  At the same time there is no over-strained tenderness, nor affectation of
  endearment; but there is a considerate, serious concern, about the
  peculiar sins and temptations of the people committed to his charge, and
  a hearty desire and determined effort for their
  salvation."&mdash;<i>Theologian.</i></p>

  <p>"Simple, intelligible, and affectionate."&mdash;<i>Church and State
  Gazette.</i></p>

  <p>"Very stirring and practical."&mdash;<i>Christian
  Remembrancer.</i></p>

  practical."&mdash;<i>English Churchman.</i></p>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
